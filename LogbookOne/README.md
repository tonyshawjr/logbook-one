# Logbook One

A simple, elegant freelance work tracker designed for independent professionals who want to keep track of their tasks, notes, and payments in one place.

## Notes System with Hashtags

Logbook One uses a smart hashtag system for organizing your notes:

### How Hashtags Work

- **Automatic Detection**: Simply type `#keyword` anywhere in your note text, and it will automatically be detected as a tag.
- **Tag Filtering**: All hashtags are collected and displayed as filters at the top of the Notes view.
- **Timeline View**: Notes are organized in a chronological timeline, grouped by date (Today, Yesterday, and previous dates).

### Example Usage

```
Meeting with client #client #important
Discussed project scope and timeline for the website redesign.
```

In this example, `#client` and `#important` will be automatically extracted as tags and added to the filtering system. The tags will be highlighted in the note text and be available for filtering all notes.

### Benefits

- No separate tagging UI required - just type naturally
- Tags are visually emphasized in your notes for quick recognition
- Flexible organization system that works the way you think
- All tags are available for filtering at the top of the Notes view
- Chronological timeline makes finding notes by date easy

### Tips

- Use consistent hashtags to build a useful organizational system
- You can search for tags in the search bar too
- Tags can be placed anywhere in your note text
- Use descriptive tags like `#meeting`, `#client`, `#idea`, etc.
